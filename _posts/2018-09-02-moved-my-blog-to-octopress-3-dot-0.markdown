I just moved my entire tech blog from Octopress 2 to 3.0. It was quite tiresome because I had my base folder before at `/blog` and somehow I had a landing page of my own on the root endpoint `/`. However, I managed it somehow and due to the mis-match, I was allowed to dig deep into designing after almost 3 years. Did some `CSS` and `HTML` as well. Added `Github` flavored markdown once again. 

Changed one `Rakefile` a bit that I was using before so that I don't end up with a lot of manual handling for blogging. Still working on the `Rakefile` to make my life easier in future. Now, the site and blog are pretty much alive with disqus comments(configured once again!). Octopress 3.0 is nothing but a very minimal version of Octopress 2. As I preferred having a home page separately, I had to dig more into designing and a bit of CMS. 

Furthermore, I have added some of my other links(those are built with Jekyll) such as my resume cards and the details of the conferences that I have spoken before on the new nav bar. Blogging on my tech blog after almost 2 years feels nice because I had to tweak the code a bit once again with `jekyll ruby` . 

Landed in the Netherlands 2 weeks before for my higher studies at Deflt University of Technology. Feels nice to check my old stuff which were online once again to make a new start. :smiley: (That smiley is also from `Github` flavored markdown). :wink:
