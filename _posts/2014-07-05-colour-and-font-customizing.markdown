I have now changed my colour scheme and font by editing (by removing some comment lines) in {% raw %}<code>sass/custom/_styles.scss</code> , <code>sass/custom/_colors.scss{% endraw %} </code> and <code>sass/custom/_fonts.scss</code>.

I referred to [this url](http://hslpicker.com/) to pick suitable colors for my page and [this blog](http://octopress.org/docs/theme/styles/) to get a good idea about how to change color scheme and style.

My color scheme has been changed and I am loving it. :) :)
