Hello everyone, this is Tworit. I am a student at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) under the Electrical Engineering Faculty (under EEMCS). 

This blog post is about stuff that I try one line at a time. I am adept in programming languages like ruby, python, elixir and a handful of scripting langauges like JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

Hardware hacking is a hobby. Installing, crashing! That's my thing. :heart: I often play with my ARM Cortex, RPi3 and Arduino. 

I worked for Bosch India for 2 years (2016 - 2018) as an OBD Calibration Engineer for passenger cars.

Furthermore, my [alter ego](http://blog.tworitdash.in/) writes about parallel universes and dreams, because writing dreams just after waking up is one of my hobbies (which is not exactly included in my quotidian routine... But yes, I do sometimes). Don't believe me? You can check my [resume](http://resume.tworitdash.in/). :relieved:

Links to the details of the conferences that I have spoken during my undergraduate studies is on the nav bar.
